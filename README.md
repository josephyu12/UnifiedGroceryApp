# UnifiedGroceryApp

UnifiedGroceryApp is an iOS app that recommends healthy, sustainable recipes to users based on items currently on-hand. This will help reduce food waste, as well as motivate the general population to cook more frequently, leading to healthier lifestyles.

*This is a project for Mass Academy's Apps for Good Program.*
